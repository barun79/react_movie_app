## ðŸ§  How It Works

- On load, the app fetches **trending movies** from the Appwrite backend or TMDB API.
- Users can **search** for any movie title via the search input.
- On every search, the app:
  1. Fetches results from the TMDB API
  2. Displays results instantly
  3. Updates search count in Appwrite (for analytics)

- Clicking on any movie opens a **full-page modal** showing:
